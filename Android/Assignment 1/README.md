# Assignment 1: Matching Game
> This is the First Assignment in the Android Programming Course at St Lawrence College (Assignments change each year). In this assignment I developed a Memory Matching Card Game. The game uses a grid of ImageButtons with onClick handlers that will dynamically change the image between the card's back and card face images. When 2 Card Faces are visible, the program will determine if the cards match. If they match, the cards will stay visible and a point will be added to the score. When all cards have been matched, the program will show a high score page and determine if the player has a new High Score. Score will be stored locally on the device. When the program starts up, the cards will be randomly assigned an image and, when the first card is flipped over, a timer will start on a thread.
