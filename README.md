> ### API Project
- The start of a Project that was supposed to have a database interact with an API.  Later turned into Assignment 3 due to some unexpected school closures.
  
> ### Assignment 1: Matching Game
- This is the First Assignment in the Android Programming Course at St Lawrence College (Assignments change each year). In this assignment I developed a Memory Matching Card Game.  The game uses a grid of `ImageButton`s with `onClick handlers` that will dynamically change the image between the card's back and card face images. When 2 Card Faces are visible, the program will determine if the cards match.  If they match, the cards will stay visible and a point will be added to the score.  When all cards have been matched, the program will show a high score page and determine if the player has a new High Score.  Score will be stored locally on the device.  When the program starts up, the cards will be randomly assigned an image and, when the first card is flipped over, a timer will start on a thread.

> ### Assignment 2: Conway's Game of Life Challenge
- This was the second assignment at College.  For this assignment we were tasked to obey Conwayâ€™s rules for the Game of Life Challenge and had the rules run on threads to determine life and death.  It also starts by randomly generating the cells.

> ### Assignment 3: Verse Lookup
-  In This assignment we required to populate a ListView which was embedded in a layout from an API.  We called the API based on some options that were pre-populated on the app.
